# RL Algorithms from Scratch

Implementations of various RL algorithms from scratch.

## Included Models

### Vanilla Policy Gradient

The simplest form of a policy gradient algorithm, based on the [OpenAI Spinning
Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro3.html)
documentation. A write-up of my approach here is included on [my
blog](https://medium.com/@alancooney/vanilla-policy-gradient-from-scratch-3c9ebb4de441).

## Benchmark

This repository also includes a benchmark [Proximal Policy
Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) (PPO) algorithm
from [Stable Baselines
3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/ppo.html). This is
useful for comparing performance.
